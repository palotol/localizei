# "Localizei"
Hello to everyone who access this repository! The project called "Localizei" was made by me (@palotol) with the objective to create my own automotive vehicles store.
During my creation i decided to inspire some aspects for my page from the website "www.localiza.com.br" which is a renowned company in the automotive vehicles sales category in Brazil.
Since then, i created the code by myself using as reference their website and my school's guidebook for HTML and CSS.

 The project is very simple and objective. You start by opening the "inicial.html" file and you can navigate between the Localizei's biography ("Sobre Nós"), the vehicles catalog  ("Catálogo"), and the disponible agencies at Rio de Janeiro ("Agências").
 When you access the catalog page, you can choose between some vehicles to rent and when the vehicle selected gets clicked you get redirected to the Checkout page.
 In the Checkout page you need to type informations such as the car selected (Which you'll need if somehow my script to automatically fill this section doesn't work), agency that you prefer to pick up your vehicle, date and pick up time.

That's it! Hope you enjoy.
